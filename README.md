CSV and Pandas.
The following scripts are being used during my PhD to calculate data from general LogFiles saved in CSV format.
The data come from visual procedure written in Java (You can find it here https://github.com/grimwj/Viscacha). The visual stimuli look like 
the ones in these videos --> https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC60ujshMHrXL6TodPkpB_UQ

The participant has to fixate the fixation spot and decide where the circular shape stimulus is located using directional arrows.
